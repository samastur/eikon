Photo Wall

Create a wall of photos (like gallery in Google+) made from either photos found
on page or provided by external services.

.photoWall( [settings] )

Settings:
- row_height
    default: 150

    Height of images in rows. Real value may be slightly different in order
    for a row to snaggly fit in space available.

- getImages( callback )
    default: undefined

    A function for fetching images to add to the wall. Needs to call
    callback function with array of found image objects. If it will be
    called as many times as necessary until it return an empty array.

    Image object has following attributes: url (image address), width and height.
    You can also provide link_url, which will be used as destination for clicks
    on images.

    If not provided, then images will be picked only from page (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

- buildBrick( img_obj, height, hidden )
    default: internal function

    Function to build a brick in the wall, which should contain exactly ONE
    image with class pw-images (the one that gets resized) and attribute
    set to 'height'.

    'img_obj' is the same object provided by getImages.

    Parameter 'hidden' can be used to hide element on page until it's
    loaded by adding a .hidden class to LI element.


Example use:
  $("#photo-wall").photoWall({
      getImages: getFlickrImages,
      row_height: 150
  })


Notes:
- wall is created only on first element from collection. Others are ignored
- subsequent calls on same element trigger reflow (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
- images are resized to requested row height even when they are smaller; it's up to
  developer to provide big enough to avoid pixelation

Known issues:
- doesn't handle resizing width of a photo box (which can happen if it's sized with % and
     page grows long enough to get a scrollbar)
- currently creates scrollbar when not needed to prevent above problem with height:101%
