EIKON

Eikon is a photo gallery currently very much like galleries in Google+. It
is incomplete and certainly buggy and I would advise against using it for
now.

At least until this text disappears, which hopefully will be soon.

It is developed by Marko Samastur (markos@gaivo.net) and licensed under
MIT license.
